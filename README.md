# Roman to Arabic Numeral Converter

Create a brand new project for a command-line application that converts a [Roman number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) to the corresponding [Arabic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals).

The application should take a string of numerals on command line until a user exits.
